## Inspiration

Non-fungible and Semi-fungible tokens represent the future of digital assets. Currently, most implementations of utility-based NFTs or SFTs are restricted to fixed supply sizes and metadata. We wanted to create a way to quantify the tolerances of NFTs and SFTs to allow for more dynamic and flexible tokenomics.

## What it does

We created a smart contract that allows for the minting of SFTs within a specified tolerance. Each SFT has seven sections of its metadata hashed through IPFS. The tolerance for minting, for this project, is defined as 15% (1/7 hashes) being unique.
